        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Curry is often described as a dish that is earthy, spicy, warming, or even sometimes sweet.
                 It is a well-balanced, richly spiced dish with notes of deep savory flavors from turmeric, 
                 coriander, cumin, bay leaf, cinnamon, and cloves, just to name a few.
                 Black pepper and red chilies provide spiciness and a rich hue</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove the skin (if there is any) from the chicken and cut it into small pieces.
                        Wash the chicken in water with the juice from the lime/lemon and the vinegar.
                        Drain away all the excess water from the chicken.
                    </li>

                <br>
                    
                    <li>In a kitchen bowl, add the chicken, onion, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper,
                        pimento berries, ginger, salt, all-purpose seasoning, the curry poweder and
                        mix everything together and leave to marinate for 30 minutes or more.
                    </li>

                <br>

                    <li>In a pot add the cooking oil and put to pot on medium heat.</li>

                <br>


                    <li>Add the seasoned chicken to the oil and stir well.
                        Let the chicken cook until lightly brown on all sides.
                        Don't let the pot burn, add a tip of water if necessary.
                    </li>

                <br>

                    <li>Stir in the carrot, potato and thyme. Add water enough to
                        cover the chicken in the pot. Cover and leave to cook for 25-30 minutes,
                        until the chicken is cooked and the water is reduced to a curry gravy.
                    </li>
                </ol>
