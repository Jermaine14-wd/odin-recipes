        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This springy and tasty steamed duff pudding is a traditional favorite in the Bahamas, where it is made with fresh guavas 
                and served with a sweet rum butter sauce. 
                It's a fairly complex recipe which requires an hour to cook the duff,
                so it's not one to attempt until you have plenty of time to spare, but the effort really is worth it!</p>
